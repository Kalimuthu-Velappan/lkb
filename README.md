struct namespace: Data caching associated with inode.
struct page: Represent a portion of physical memory

```
struct request_queue: IO queue associated with device
struct request: Individual request within a request_queue
struct bio: Represents an unit of IO. A request_queue have many bioâ€™s
struct bio_vec: Keeps 1) buffer info which is to be transferred, 2) start end of the buffer to be 				transferred. 3) struct page information 
struct gendisk: Represent a physical disk.
